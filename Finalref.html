    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>We want to find out how users interact with the app while actually taking medication and how they recover from errors. To do this, we investigate these two separate things in our experiment. </p>

    <p>The users we want are people who take multiple medications or supplements during the course of a day, but not more than 6 or 7. They have trouble remembering and taking medications consistently, and have busy schedules. They use a digital calendar. Taking medications at slightly different times is not life-threatening for them.</p>

    <p><b>Part 1: Interaction with real objects</b></p>

    <p>The first part of the experiment helps us see how the user behaves when taking medicine, and when they record things on the app relative to when they perform the analogous actions in real life. </p>

    <p><i>Hypothesis:</i></p>

    <p>Users will indicate taking their medicine in app immediately following them actually taking their medicine.</p>

    <p>To test this hypothesis, we don’t need to present variants of our design- we will keep the app constant, because we want to observe how the user inserts the app into their routine- the variability will come from the users. </p>

    <p>We will measure the time between the user taking the medication and when they record it in-app. We will also document the order of the actions.</p>

    <p>Because the variability comes from the users, we would ideally like to test with a larger sample size (~30), and see whether the time between medication and recording (and the order) changes with repeated use as the user gets more familiar with the app, as there may be a difference between how they behave during first-time use as opposed to when they have more understanding of the app.</p>

    <p><b>Part 2: Recovering from errors</b></p>

    <p>The second part of the experiment involves A/B testing for two fundamentally different approaches to how to deal with people accidentally swiping on medications they haven’t taken.</p>

    <p><i>Hypothesis:</i></p>

    <p>The confirmation model will take more time for users on average, but will be faster than the undo model upon making an error. Most users will not make errors often enough to be helped by having confirmation always on. </p>

    <p>We will present users with two apps that have undoing as an option. App A have a confirmation window each time you indicate you have taken a medication, while App B will require you to go through the undo process if you do not swipe correctly. </p>

    <p>This would ideally be conducted with at least 10 users, where we measure how long it takes to go through the two procedures, how often they make mistakes while swiping, and how long it takes them to discover undoing. </p>

    <p><i>*We have no prior experience in the design of controlled experiments for user testing.</i></p>

    <h1 class="w3-jumbo"><b>Final Report</b></h1>
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>What is Caterpill?</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <center><div class="w3-container">
        <img src="./images/Caterpill.png" style="width:40%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Caterpill">

    <p><a href="https://framer.cloud/ScXNZ">Link to the prototype!!</a></p>

    <p>Caterpill is an app that helps you remember to take your medications on time. The goal is to find the best time to take things so that even with schedule changes and a busy lifestyle, you’re always taking your medicine at the best time for you given the requirements of when you need to take it.</p>


    <p><a href="http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2018/ubuntu/index.html#NeedsNarr">Our users</a> are comfortable with technology and have a busy life. They are taking medicines/supplements and want reminders and help monitoring their health, but don’t want it to be too disruptive or difficult.</p>

    <p>We’ve heard from our users that they are pretty good at managing taking things when they have a routine to fall back on, but when the routine changes or with increased stressors, things become much harder to handle. Caterpill is here to help increase the likelihood that you will remember to take your medicine on time, even when things change.</p>

    <p>Caterpill helps you find the best time to take your medicine by looking at information on your calendar. We use this information to determine when you’ll most likely be able to regularly take your medicine, based on the medication requirements, your preferences, and when you have free time.</p>

    <p>We emphasized making Caterpill fun and friendly, and making the core interaction—indicating that you’ve taken your medicine—as satisfying as possible. </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>About Caterpill’s features</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p><b>Reminders based on schedule:</b></p>

    <p>The current products on the market can be very simple with setting a reminder by a certain time. From the experience with our user testing, this reminder can come a the wrong time making this element of your daily life something increasing stress. Since Caterpill is connected to your schedule it makes sure to remind when you have the time to be reminded. </p>

    <p>To implement this, on the main screen there is an overview of the pills of the day, and an overview of the schedule to easily see when medicine is scheduled to be taken. Our users often may know they need to take their medicine, but if the time they usually take it is too inconvenient, they often end up missing it. Having reminders based on schedule information and softer, friendlier reminders helps resolve this problem.</p>

    <p><b>Animations, Swiping to Take Medicine, and Tone:</b></p>

    <p>We also found that the clinical, text-in-windows design of other apps isn’t inviting, and the reminders are quite impersonal and annoying in tone. We found that in period tracking apps, a more friendly interface and text that was less stress-inducing helped retain users and made the experience more enjoyable.</p>

    <p>We made use of cognitive walkthroughs and usability testing in designing the interaction around the animations, such as moving Caterpill. It quickly became clear that we needed to think about a few crucial corner cases, mainly taking single and multiple pills now or in the near future. For multiple pills, it’s important to be able to quickly take all pills at once but also take only a subset. Our solution was to animate available pills such that they separate so you could carefully pick a subset or swipe across the line they draw. Testing with cognitive walkthroughs helped us refine our interactions and animations.</p>

    <p>We also decided when prototyping with Framer to hide the details of daily schedule in the main homepage, and have it be pulled out as if a navigation drawer from the left on swipe. The idea was to reduce the amount of information on the main page while allowing the user to get more information when needed. We also like to think about Caterpill as an app that uses a calendar, rather than a calendar app. That is to say, we intentionally limit functionality only revolving around the calendar.</p>

    <p>For more information, see the <a href="http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2018/ubuntu/DesRef.html">design refinement page</a> on our website. </p>

    <p><b>Shortcomings and further work</b></p>

    <p>We started thinking about adding symptom and side effect tracking as well as location-based reminders. We reduced the scope of our project to be able to prototype the core interactions, but those features would still enhance the user experience. In addition, we ignored certain corner cases (some examples include taking 30 medicines at a time, mislabeled medication or incorrect instructions, and the camera not recognizing medicine information) to focus on the core experience. Our add pill experience is incomplete, and makes many simplifying assumptions about camera usage. We also did not implement lockscreen reminders in our final prototype.</p>

    <p>For the features we have implemented, we need more extensive A/B and other usability testing to refine what we have and ensure that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMpjyJoDFaIjU5HS-qHYvjIQod3ZDR94RuqR44QwCw8/edit">our response</a> to the problems that were identified in our heuristic evaluation was sufficient. </p>

    <p>Notes for this phase:</p>
    <ul> We wanted to work more on our prototype to get it to the MVP, therefore we made the decision to take the first week of the final refinement phase to continue to work and implement things on our product. We still conducted A/B testing. </ul>

    <p>Important decisions for final refinement:</p>

    <ul>We wanted to work more on our prototype to get it to the MVP, therefore we made the decision to take the first week of the final refinement phase to continue to work and implement things on our product.</ul>
    <ul>Responded to the heuristic evaluation given to us where we made some changes. Response listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMpjyJoDFaIjU5HS-qHYvjIQod3ZDR94RuqR44QwCw8/edit?usp=sharing">“heuristic evaluation response”</a></ul>
