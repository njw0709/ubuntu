    <p>We want to find out how users interact with the app while actually taking medication and how they recover from errors. To do this, we investigate these two separate things in our experiment. </p>

    <p>The users we want are people who take multiple medications or supplements during the course of a day, but not more than 6 or 7. They have trouble remembering and taking medications consistently, and have busy schedules. They use a digital calendar. Taking medications at slightly different times is not life-threatening for them.</p>

    <p><b>Part 1: Interaction with real objects</b></p>

    <p>The first part of the experiment helps us see how the user behaves when taking medicine, and when they record things on the app relative to when they perform the analogous actions in real life. </p>

    <p><i>Hypothesis:</i></p>

    <p>Users will indicate taking their medicine in app immediately following them actually taking their medicine.</p>

    <p>To test this hypothesis, we don’t need to present variants of our design- we will keep the app constant, because we want to observe how the user inserts the app into their routine- the variability will come from the users. </p>

    <p>We will measure the time between the user taking the medication and when they record it in-app. We will also document the order of the actions.</p>

    <p>Because the variability comes from the users, we would ideally like to test with a larger sample size (~30), and see whether the time between medication and recording (and the order) changes with repeated use as the user gets more familiar with the app, as there may be a difference between how they behave during first-time use as opposed to when they have more understanding of the app.</p>

    <p><b>Part 2: Recovering from errors</b></p>

    <p>The second part of the experiment involves A/B testing for two fundamentally different approaches to how to deal with people accidentally swiping on medications they haven’t taken.</p>

    <p><i>Hypothesis:</i></p>

    <p>The confirmation model will take more time for users on average, but will be faster than the undo model upon making an error. Most users will not make errors often enough to be helped by having confirmation always on. </p>

    <p>We will present users with two apps that have undoing as an option. App A have a confirmation window each time you indicate you have taken a medication, while App B will require you to go through the undo process if you do not swipe correctly. </p>

    <p>This would ideally be conducted with at least 10 users, where we measure how long it takes to go through the two procedures, how often they make mistakes while swiping, and how long it takes them to discover undoing. </p>

    <p><i>*We have no prior experience in the design of controlled experiments for user testing.</i></p>
